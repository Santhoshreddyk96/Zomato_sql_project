# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_Analysis_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE zomato_Analysis;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
drop table if exists orders
drop table if exists customers
drop table if exists restaurants
drop table if exists riders
drop table if exists deliveries

create table customers(
                       customer_id int primary key,
					   customer_name varchar(30),
					   reg_date date
					   )



create table restaurants(
                       restaurant_id int primary key,
					   restaurant_name varchar(50),
					   city varchar(20),
					   opening_hours varchar(50)
					   )


create table orders(
                       order_id int primary key,
					   customer_id int ,--this is coming from cust_table
					   restaurant_id int ,--this is coming from rest_table
					   order_item varchar(50),
					   order_date date,
					   order_time time,
					   order_status varchar(20),
					   total_amount float
					   )

--adding FK constraints

alter table orders
add constraint fk_customers
foreign key(customer_id)
references customers(customer_id)

alter table orders
add constraint fk_restaurant
foreign key(restaurant_id)
references restaurants(restaurant_id)


create table riders(
                      rider_id int primary key,
					  rider_name varchar(50),
					  sign_up date
					)



create table deliveries(
						  delivery_id int primary key,
						  order_id int,--thi is coming from orders table
						  delivery_status varchar(20),
						  delivery_time time,
						  rider_id int--this is coming from riders table
						  constraint fk_orders foreign key(order_id) references orders(order_id),
						  constraint fk_riders foreign key(rider_id) references riders(rider_id)
					    )
);
```

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
select count(*)
from customers
where customer_name is null
       or
	  reg_date is null



select count(*)
from restaurants
where restaurant_name is null
       or
	  city is null
	  or
	  opening_hours is null


select count(*)
from orders
where
	  order_item is null
	  or
	  order_date is null
	  or
	  order_time is null
	  or
	  order_status is null
	  or
	  total_amount is null

```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.

```sql
select top 5 order_item,count(order_item) as No_of_times_ordered,DENSE_RANK() over(order by count(*) desc) as rank
			from orders o
			join customers c on c.customer_id= o.customer_id
			where c.customer_name='Arjun Mehta'
				  and
				  o.order_date >=dateadd(year,-2,getdate())	  
			group by order_item
```

### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.

**Approach 1:**

```sql
select 
	   case
	      when datepart(hour,order_time) between 0 and 1 then '00:00-02:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 2 and 3 then '02:00-04:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 4 and 5 then '04:00-06:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 6 and 7 then '06:00-08:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 8 and 9 then '08:00-10:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 10 and 11 then '10:00-12:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 12 and 13 then '12:00-14:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 14 and 15 then '14:00-16:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between  16 and 17 then '16:00-18:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 18 and 19 then '18:00-20:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 20 and 21 then '20:00-22:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 22 and 23 then '22:00-00:00'
	   end as time_slot,
	   count(order_id) as order_count
from orders
group by 
       case
	      when datepart(hour,order_time) between 0 and 1 then '00:00-02:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 2 and 3 then '02:00-04:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 4 and 5 then '04:00-06:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 6 and 7 then '06:00-08:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 8 and 9 then '08:00-10:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 10 and 11 then '10:00-12:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 12 and 13 then '12:00-14:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 14 and 15 then '14:00-16:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between  16 and 17 then '16:00-18:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 18 and 19 then '18:00-20:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 20 and 21 then '20:00-22:00'
		  when datepart(hour,order_time) between 22 and 23 then '22:00-00:00'
	   end
order by order_count desc 

--Other approach using floor 


select
       floor(datepart(hour,order_time)/2)*2 as start_time,
	   floor(datepart(hour,order_time)/2)*2 +2 as end_time,
	   count(*) as total_orders
from orders
group by floor(datepart(hour,order_time)/2)*2 ,floor(datepart(hour,order_time)/2)*2 +2
order by count(*) desc
```

### 3. Order Value Analysis
-- Question: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return customer_name, and aov(average order value)

```sql
select c.customer_name,
       --o.customer_id,
	   AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
	   count(o.order_id) as total_orders
from orders o
join customers c on c.customer_id=o.customer_id		
group by c.customer_name
having count(o.order_id)>750

```

### 4. High-Value Customers
-- Question: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- return customer_name, and customer_id!

```sql
select c.customer_name,
	   sum(o.total_amount) as total_spent
from orders o
join customers c on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
group by c.customer_name
having sum(o.total_amount)>100000

select * from customers
select * from orders
select*from restaurants

select * 
from orders o
right join customers c on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
order by order_id DESC
```

### 5. Orders Without Delivery
-- Question: Write a query to find orders that were placed but not delivered. 
-- Return each restuarant name, city and number of not delivered orders 

```sql
select r.restaurant_name,count(o.order_status) as orders_not_delivered
from orders o
join restaurants r on r.restaurant_id=o.restaurant_id

## Conclusion

This project highlights my ability to handle complex SQL queries and provides solutions to real-world business problems in the context of a food delivery service like Zomato. The approach taken here demonstrates a structured problem-solving methodology, data manipulation skills, and the ability to derive actionable insights from data.

## Notice 
All customer names and data used in this project are computer-generated using AI and random functions. They do not represent real data associated with Zomato or any other entity. This project is solely for learning and educational purposes, and any resemblance to actual persons, businesses, or events is purely coincidental.
